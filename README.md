# NSFLStatsWeb

Works in conjunction with the [NSFLWebScraper project](https://github.com/blackmage37/NSFLWebScraper) to take the data from the main forum and present it in a digestible format. Relies on some specific formatting in thread titles, specifically, `(Sxx) - Player Name Goes Here - Pos` with the subtitle `TPE: xxx` (NO separators in the number here)

I'll add more info later.

Planned future developments:
* Store data in a database
** implement historic lookups
* Restore the Team TPE calculation, taking the figures from the parsed data rather than separate files
* Add other stats from the league index
